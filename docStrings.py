        Python documentation strings (or docstrings) provide a convenient way of associating documentation with Python modules, functions, classes, and methods. Itâ€™s specified in source code that is used, like a comment, to document a specific segment of code. Unlike conventional source code comments, the docstring should describe what the function does, not how.
        Example of doc string.
        The function accepts a num and return its factorial.
